## What is Three Doors? ###
Three Doors is a 2D, Voxel Game made using the Unity3D game engine, and assets from Kenney.nl.  The concept of the game is similar to Magicite, Terraria, and Minecraft in many respects, yet what makes the project the most interesting is the concept, and the broad things you will be able to do in the final project.  NOTE: MINING WILL NEVER BE A FEATURE!!!

### What is this repository for? ###
This repository is used as a great way to keep track of code changes, new ideas, and revert unnecessary "updates, all with the power of Git.  The code is powered mainly by SmartGit, a great GUI for Windows, Mac, and (Thankfully) Linux.  

### How do I get set up? ###
When starting the project for the first time, it may take a while to open.  This is due to Unity having to generate new Library and Temp folders, as well as MonoDevelop generating new .sln builds.  This is not necessary for the final product, so .gitignore ignores any new additions.
