# PROJECT SUMMARY #

## What is Three Doors? (Possibly consider renaming to Exploxels) ###

### TECHNICAL ###
Three Doors is a 2D, Voxel Game made using the Unity3D game engine, and assets from Kenney.NL.  The concept of the game is similar to Magicite, Terraria, and Minecraft in many respects, yet what makes the project the most interesting is the concept, and the broad things you will be able to do in the final project.  It is coded entirely in C#.  Stay tuned for development!

### GAMEPLAY SUMMARY ###
Players in Exploxels travel through the most notable points in human history: working their way from the Ice Age up into the Stone Age, all the way to Modern Day.  Along the way, they have choices of professions, which will change the way their character appears and the tools they are allowed to use.  The different eras are all different scenes, with different enemies and terrain.  The main concept of the game remains the same, however.  The one problem that is notable is the fact that I have no freaking idea what the point for beating the game will be.  "Oh, you have to try to become the master of the universe!"  Probably not.  

### What is this repository for? ###
This repository is used as a great way to keep track of code changes, new ideas, and revert unnecessary "updates, all with the power of Git.  The code is powered mainly by SmartGit, a great GUI for Windows, Mac, and (Thankfully) Linux.  

### How do I get set up? ###
When starting the project for the first time, it may take a while to open.  This is due to Unity having to generate new Library and Temp folders, as well as MonoDevelop generating new .sln builds.  This is not necessary for the final product, so .gitignore ignores any new additions.
