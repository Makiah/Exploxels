# README #

This repository manages the version control of the Three Doors Project.  I am working to create this item in Unity, so the main language is C#.  

### What is this repository for? ###

Description - Three Doors is a 2D, voxel game, based off of the assets on the kenney.nl webpage.  It is still a work in progress, but 
many new features have been added.  
Version - 0.5

### How do I get set up? ###

Summary of set up
Open the project file in Unity (at least 5.2.0) and edit project files.  Once complete, use SmartGit to stage the changes (all with CTRL + A) 
and commit.
