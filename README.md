# PROJECT SUMMARY #

## What is Three Doors? ###
### TECHNICAL ###
Three Doors is a 2D, Voxel Game made using the Unity3D game engine, and assets from Kenney.NL.  The concept of the game is similar to Magicite, Terraria, and Minecraft in many respects, yet what makes the project the most interesting is the concept, and the broad things you will be able to do in the final project.  NOTE: MINING WILL NEVER BE A FEATURE!!!
### GAMEPLAY SUMMARY ###
Players start off in a randomly generated (procedurally) world.  (Note: Entirely different from current spawn system).  Player meets a man who directs him
to a village, who explains the game basics (subtlely), gives the player some money, and the player continues into a village.  Within the village, the player 
receives traits that give bonuses to the player stats (Ex. Wizard NPC gives player magic capability bonus).  Once complete in the village, the player moves 
into District 1.  A few NPCs roam about, but the world is mainly inhabited by skeletons, zombies, boars, the lot.  As the player ventures around the landscape, 
he/she searches for a door that will lead to the next level (objective is to get to final level).  Once found, the player can continue on to the next level at 
any point that the player chooses.  Districts continue until finally, the boss is battled and [hopefully] defeated.  PERMADEATH IN EFFECT.  

### What is this repository for? ###
This repository is used as a great way to keep track of code changes, new ideas, and revert unnecessary "updates, all with the power of Git.  The code is powered mainly by SmartGit, a great GUI for Windows, Mac, and (Thankfully) Linux.  

### How do I get set up? ###
When starting the project for the first time, it may take a while to open.  This is due to Unity having to generate new Library and Temp folders, as well as MonoDevelop generating new .sln builds.  This is not necessary for the final product, so .gitignore ignores any new additions.
