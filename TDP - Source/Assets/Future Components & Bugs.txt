COMPONENTS, BUGS, AND IDEAS

FIXES TO BE MADE
 - After the initial jump animation is complete, the arm rotates backwards on returning to the walk animation, or the double jump animation.  
 - Trees are a bit off of the ground, so a few quick refinements could be made to place the points in contact with the ground.  
 - The ground-checking code casts a line from the player position to the groundCheck position.  This should be re-written to cast from a point some
   distance on the x-axis to the right, to another point some distance to the left.  
 - Resize weapon images so the cursor images are not too large.  
   
COOL NEW FEATURE IDEAS
 - Skeletons!!!
 - Zombies!!!
 - User Interface!!!
 - Day/Night Cycle!!!
 - Crafting!!!
 - Villages!!!
 - Stackable Resources (Customizably)
 - Drops that follow the player.  
 
Skeleton AI
 - Same skeletal structure as the player, but different sprites.  Walk animations are the same, as are jump and shooting, but script controls the animations differently.
